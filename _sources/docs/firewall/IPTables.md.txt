# IPTables

IPTables is a command line utility for configuring the Linux kernel firewall implemented within the Netfilter project. It is the de facto Linux firewall. And it gets complex rather quickly which increases the risk of making mistakes. 

For a bare metal server running only a dedicated application, such as a Schleuder list, iptables is the simplest (and minimalistic) choice. 

## Disable FirewallD

Note: As of CentOS version 7, [FirewallD](FirewallD.md) replaces IPTables as the default firewall management tool.

Stop the FirewallD service

    # systemctl stop firewalld

Disable it to start automatically on system boot

    # systemctl disable firewalld

Mask it to prevent it from being started by other services

    # systemctl mask --now firewalld

## Install and enable IPTables

    # yum install iptables-services

Start the service:
    # systemctl start iptables
    # systemctl start iptables6

Enable automatic start on system boot

    # systemctl enable iptables
    # systemctl enable iptables6

Check iptables service status

    # systemctl status iptables
    # systemctl status iptables6

## Rules 

### Status command

To list rules -L showing interface name, rule options, TOS masks, packet and byte counters -n, and IP address and port in numeric format without using DNS to resolve names -v:
    
    # iptables -L -n -v

With line numbers (important for deleting or inserting new rules into the firewall):

    # iptables -n -L -v --line-numbers

To display INPUT or OUTPUT chain rules:

    # iptables -L INPUT -n -v
    # iptables -L OUTPUT -n -v --line-numbers

### Deleting a rule

To delete line number 4 using -D to delete one or more rules from the selected chain:

    # iptables -D INPUT 4

### Inserting a rule 

    # iptables -L INPUT -n --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
    num  target     prot opt source               destination
    1    DROP       all  --  xxx.xxx.xxx.1        0.0.0.0/0
    2    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW,ESTABLISHED 

Inserting a rule between 1 and 2:

    # iptables -I INPUT 2 -s xxx.xxx.xxx.2 -j DROP

Gives:

    # iptables -L INPUT -n --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
    num  target     prot opt source               destination
    1    DROP       all  --  xxx.xxx.xxx.1        0.0.0.0/0
    2    DROP       all  --  xxx.xxx.xxx.2        0.0.0.0/0
    3    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW,ESTABLISHED

### Saving the rules

For saving the rules so they can be loaded at every reboot (you need to have iptables-persistent installed)

    # iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
    # ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6

### Stop/Restart

Some distros like CentOS have installed a service called `iptables` to start and stop the firewall and a configuration file to configure it. For all other distros, `iptables` is a command, not a service.

If you edited the configuration file manually, you have to reload iptables.

Or load it directly through iptables:

    # iptables-restore < /etc/iptables/iptables.rules

## Usage

To deny all incoming and allow all outgoing connections ON A BARE METAL MACHINE where you have ACCESS TO THE CONSOLE:

    # Set default chain policies
    iptables -P INPUT DROP
    iptables -P FORWARD DROP
    iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

    # Accept on localhost
    iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

    # Allow established sessions to receive traffic
    iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

### SSH

For SSH access (-I inserts it before all other rules in INPUT):

    # iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

If your SSH service is listening on another port, use that port instead of 22.

### OpenVPN

Create an iptables rule for NAT forwarding. An example (assuming the interface to forward to is named eth0):

    # iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

If the server cannot be pinged through the VPN, [rules to open up TUN/TAP interfaces](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/255-qconnection-initiated-with-xxxxq-but-i-cannot-ping-the-server-through-the-vpn) to all traffic may be needed:

    # iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

Set up rules for accepting connections from the OpenVPN port (default 1194) and through the physical interface, and make the changes permanent.

### SMTP Secure Sockets Layer

With SMTP Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enabled, allow connections to port 587 (similar for 465).

Add the rule for this port:

    # iptables -I INPUT 2 -p tcp --dport 587 -j ACCEPT

Add the POP and IMAP ports and their secure counterparts:

    # iptables -I INPUT 3 -p tcp --dport 110 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 143 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 993 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -I INPUT 6 -p tcp --dport 995 -j ACCEPT

Save the iptables rules and restart iptables.
