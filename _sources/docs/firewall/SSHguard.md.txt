# SSHguard 

[sshguard](https://www.sshguard.net/) is a daemon that protects SSH and other services against brute-force attacks, similar to [Fail2ban](Fail2ban.md). It is lighter and simpler to use.

sshguard is not vulnerable to most (or maybe any) of the log analysis vulnerabilities that have caused problems for similar tools.
