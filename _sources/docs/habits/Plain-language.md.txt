# Plain language 

Minimise making others dependent. Accidents are waiting round the corner and others must be able to take over. Document what you (will) do and comment config files for that, in plain language:

* Plain language is clear, straightforward, using only as many words as necessary.
* Avoid obscurity, inflated vocabulary and convoluted sentence constructions. A joke now and then is okay. Provides oxygen to the brain and relaxes.
* It is not baby talk, nor a simplified language.
* Writers of plain language let their readers concentrate on the message instead of being distracted by complicated language.
* Include supportive images and examples/output of commands for readers to understand the documentation easily.
* Plain language is writing that readers can understand and act upon the first time they read it.

So I make notes. To myself, and on occasion for particular purposes I provide more detail.
