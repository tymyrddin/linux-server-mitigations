# Healthy habits

  * [Write protect configuration files](Chattr.md). 
  * Restrict access to directories with proper permissions.
  * Do not do development on production systems.
  * Use root account only when required. Use sudo to grant others (sudo) root level access.
  * No job security. [Document and comment in plain language](Plain-language.md).
  * Be lazy. Automate routine tasks to make time for keeping current, thinking, puzzling with configurations, security research, and exploring new tools. 
    * [Automate backups](../backups/Simple-script.md)
    * [Centralise logging](../logfiles/Centralised-logging.md)
    * Use a [configuration management tool](Puppet.md)
