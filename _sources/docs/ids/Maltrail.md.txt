# Maltrail

Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, using publicly available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious //trails//, static trails compiled from various AV reports and custom user-defined lists, and (optionally) advanced heuristic mechanisms that can help in the discovery of unknown threats (for example, new malware). It is based on a Traffic -> Sensor <-> Server <-> Client Architecture.

//Trail// can be anything from a domain name (like `zvpprsensinaix.com` for Banjori malware), URL (like `<nowiki>http://109.162.38.120/harsh02.exe</nowiki>` for known malicious executable), IP address (for example `185.130.5.231` for known attacker) or HTTP User-Agent header value (like `sqlmap` for automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool).
