# Docker

With Docker application tiers and services can be separated from one another, and from data. Docker lightens the load on the servers. Docker containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through defined channels. All containers on a server are run by a single operating-system kernel. Perfect for pentesting applications.

The community edition (CE) of Docker needs a maintained version of CentOS 7. Archived versions arenâ€™t supported or tested. The ''centos-extras'' repository must be enabled and the ''overlay2'' storage driver is recommended. CentOS 7 minimally requires 1GB of memory and 20GB of hard disk space (10GB minimum).
