# Services audit

A number of services may be running by default:

* Public services accessible to anyone on the internet (anonymously). For example, a web server allowing access to a site.
* Private services intended to be only accessible by a select group of accounts or locations. Examples are a VPN server or a database control panel.
* Internal services intended to be only accessible from within the server itself, without exposing the service to the outside world. For example, a database that only accepts local connections.
* Include Network services audits
