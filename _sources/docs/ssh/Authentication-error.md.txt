# Authentication error

By default, the SSH client verifies the identity of the host to which it connects. If the remote host key is unknown, a user trying to connect is asked to accept it by typing “yes” or “no”. And it may fail.

Besides a en:hacking:cryptography:cryptanalysis:man-itm|[mitm attack]] (Make sure this is not the case from a trusted source. An adversary may be spoofing the host and continuing may give the adversary the information they seek to attack your server), this can also happen
* after [changing a key](Key-management.md): edit `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file and remove the offending line. In the above example that is line 10.
* when using ssh on a LAN (where DHCP is used and IP addresses change) 
* when jumping to multiple hosts from a jump host.

## Bypassing verification (not recommended) 

To disable the host key checking and the warnings, set `StrictHostKeyChecking no` in `~/.ssh/config` and `UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` to send the key to a null `known_hosts` file to avoid future mismatches, and **both defeat the intended verification security purpose**. 

For all hosts
    
    Host *
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
   
For 192.168.0.0/24

    Host 192.168.0.*
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null

Even with `StrictHostKeyChecking` set to `no`, a user may still be refused to connect when connecting via [ProxyJump](ProxyJump.md) or [ProxyCommand](ProxyCommand.md) with multiple hosts through a jumphost. 

ProxyJump issues another `ssh` process, that does not inherit the command-line arguments that were specified on the command-line of the first `ssh` command.

    Host jumphost
    User jumpuser
    StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jumpuser_rsa
  
Get more information on what is happening with the [ProxyCommand](ProxyCommand.md):

    ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -i ~/.ssh/id_jumpuser_rsa -W %h:%p jumpuser@jumphost" -i ~/.ssh/id_jumpuser_rsa jumpuser@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

## HostKeyAlias

HostKeyAlias specifies an alias that should be used instead of the real host name when looking up or saving the host key in the host key database files. This option is useful for tunnelling SSH connections or for **multiple servers running on a single host**. It caches the remote public under the alias name. Useful if different openSSH servers are listening on different ports of the same physical server, because normally the port number is not stored when caching public host keys. If the key has a different name (alias) both keys can be cached and valid.

    Host jumphost
    HostName XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    User user
    HostKeyAlias jumphost
    ProxyCommand ssh anotheruser@backendserver nc %h %p

## CheckHostIP 

And what if there are 2 different host keys for the same IP, or when the IP's change (DHCP on a LAN for example)?
If `CheckHostIP` is set to `yes` (default), `ssh` will check the host IP address in the known_hosts file. This allows ssh to detect if a host key changed due to DNS spoofing. If the option is set to `no`, the check will not be executed.
